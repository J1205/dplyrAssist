This is the resubmission of the package 'dplyrAssist'

1) I added executable exaples for all auxillary functions.

2) I replaced all double spaces in description by single space.

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.4.1
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.
